# 1. Introduction to LLMs in Python

Large Language Models (LLMs) are deep neural networks designed to understand and generate human language. In Python, you can work with them using libraries like Hugging Face’s Transformers, which simplify access to pre-trained models and offer high-level pipelines.

### **Using a Pipeline for Summarization**

**What it is:**  
Pipelines offer a simple interface to perform tasks like summarization without having to manually tokenize text or handle model inference details.

**Example:**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a summarization pipeline with a pre-trained model (e.g., BART)
summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="facebook/bart-large-cnn")

# Input text to summarize
text = (
    "Artificial intelligence is transforming the world by enabling machines to learn "
    "from data. It has applications in various domains such as healthcare, finance, and robotics. "
    "Large Language Models (LLMs) represent one of the most groundbreaking developments in AI."
)

# Generate a summary
summary = summarizer(text, max_length=60, min_length=30, do_sample=False)
print("Summary:", summary)
```

### **Cleaning Up Replies**

**What it is:**  
After generating text, it may include unwanted whitespace or formatting artifacts. Cleaning up replies ensures a polished output.

**Example:**

```python
import re

def clean_text(text):
    # Replace multiple spaces or newlines with a single space
    cleaned = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', text)
    return cleaned.strip()

raw_text = "  This is a generated reply...   \n   It contains extra whitespace and newlines.  "
cleaned_text = clean_text(raw_text)
print("Cleaned Reply:", cleaned_text)
```

---

### **Using Pre-Trained LLMs & Generating Text**

**What it is:**  
Pre-trained models like GPT-2 are available off the shelf for generating text. They’re trained on vast amounts of data and can continue a prompt naturally.

**Example (Text Generation):**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a text-generation pipeline with GPT-2
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")

prompt = "Once upon a time in a futuristic city,"
generated = generator(prompt, max_length=50, num_return_sequences=1)
print("Generated Text:", generated)
```

---

### **Translating Text**

**What it is:**  
LLMs can be used for translation. Models like those from the Helsinki-NLP series convert text from one language to another.

**Example (Translation):**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Load a translation pipeline (English to French)
translator = pipeline("translation_en_to_fr", model="Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-fr")

english_text = "Hello, how are you today?"
translated = translator(english_text, max_length=40)
print("Translated Text:", translated)
```

---

### **Understanding & Identifying the Transformer Architecture**

**What it is:**  
Transformers use self-attention mechanisms to process data in parallel. Understanding their components (e.g., multi-head attention, positional encoding) is key.

**Example (Inspecting Model Config):**

```python
from transformers import AutoModel, AutoConfig

# Load model configuration for a transformer (e.g., BERT)
config = AutoConfig.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
print("Model Configuration:")
print("Number of layers:", config.num_hidden_layers)
print("Hidden size:", config.hidden_size)

# Load the model to see its structure
model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
print("Model Structure:", model)
```

*This snippet shows how to inspect the configuration and structure of a transformer model, helping you identify the components and parameters used.*

### **Using the Correct Model Structure**

**What it is:**  
Different tasks benefit from different architectures. For example, GPT (unidirectional) is great for text generation, while BERT (bidirectional) excels in understanding context.

**Example (Loading a Specific Model for a Task):**

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer

# For a classification task, use a model fine-tuned on that task
model_name = "distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Tokenize an example sentence and get a classification
inputs = tokenizer("I love using transformers for NLP tasks!", return_tensors="pt")
outputs = model(**inputs)
print("Classification Outputs:", outputs.logits)
```

---

# 2. Fine-Tuning LLMs

Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained model to a specific task or domain. You leverage datasets (often from Hugging Face) and use libraries like the Trainer API to refine the model’s performance.

### **Preparing for Fine-Tuning & Tokenizing Text**

**Example (Tokenizing with a Pre-Trained Tokenizer):**

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
text = "Fine-tuning is essential for adapting pre-trained models to new tasks."
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
print("Tokens:", tokens)

# Convert tokens to input IDs
input_ids = tokenizer.convert_tokens_to_ids(tokens)
print("Input IDs:", input_ids)
```

---

### **Fine-Tuning Through Training**

**Example (Using Hugging Face’s Trainer API):**

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, Trainer, TrainingArguments
from datasets import load_dataset

# Load a dataset for a text classification task
dataset = load_dataset("glue", "mrpc", split="train")

# Load tokenizer and tokenize the dataset
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased")
def tokenize_function(examples):
    return tokenizer(examples["sentence1"], examples["sentence2"], truncation=True)
tokenized_dataset = dataset.map(tokenize_function, batched=True)

# Load a pre-trained model for sequence classification
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("bert-base-uncased", num_labels=2)

# Set up training arguments
training_args = TrainingArguments(
    output_dir="./results",
    evaluation_strategy="epoch",
    learning_rate=2e-5,
    per_device_train_batch_size=8,
    num_train_epochs=3,
    weight_decay=0.01,
)

# Initialize Trainer
trainer = Trainer(
    model=model,
    args=training_args,
    train_dataset=tokenized_dataset,
)

# Start fine-tuning
trainer.train()
```

---

### **Transfer Learning with One-Shot Learning**

**What it is:**  
One-shot learning adapts a model to a new task using very few examples. You can guide the model with a well-crafted prompt.

**Example (Prompt Engineering for Few-Shot Learning):**

```python
from transformers import pipeline

# Using a pre-trained text generation model
generator = pipeline("text-generation", model="gpt2")

# Craft a prompt that includes a single example to guide the model
prompt = (
    "Example: Translate 'Hello' to French: 'Bonjour'\n"
    "Now translate 'Goodbye' to French:"
)

generated = generator(prompt, max_length=60, num_return_sequences=1)
print("One-Shot Translation Example:", generated)
```

# 3. Evaluating LLM Performance

Evaluating model performance involves quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments. The `evaluate` library simplifies this process by providing standard metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and perplexity.

### **Using the Evaluate Library for BLEU**

**Example (Computing BLEU Score):**

```python
import evaluate

# Load the BLEU metric
bleu_metric = evaluate.load("bleu")

# Example predictions and references
predictions = ["The cat is on the mat."]
references = [["There is a cat on the mat."]]

# Compute BLEU score
bleu_score = bleu_metric.compute(predictions=predictions, references=references)
print("BLEU Score:", bleu_score)
```

---

### **Evaluating Perplexity**

**Example (Calculating Perplexity with GPT-2):**

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "gpt2"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)

text = "This is a sample sentence for calculating perplexity."
inputs = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt")

# Calculate loss and perplexity
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(**inputs, labels=inputs["input_ids"])
    loss = outputs.loss
    perplexity = torch.exp(loss)

print("Perplexity:", perplexity.item())
```

---

### **Safeguarding LLMs: Checking Toxicity**

**Example (Using Detoxify for Toxicity Checking):**

```python
# First, install detoxify if needed: pip install detoxify
from detoxify import Detoxify

# Initialize Detoxify to check for toxic language
detoxifier = Detoxify('original')
text_to_check = "I absolutely love this product!"
toxicity_scores = detoxifier.predict(text_to_check)
print("Toxicity Scores:", toxicity_scores)
```
